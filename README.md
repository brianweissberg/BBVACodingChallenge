### Description
------
This simple app pings an API that provides information and U.S. states and territories in a tableview. It displays that information in a single table view. It utilizes a custom framework to help generate custom tableview cells. 

### Notes to reviewers
------
- The framework exports a custom UIView instead of a UITableView cell. While I tried my best to figure out how to export a custom UITableView cell using a framework, I did not figure that part out in time to submit this project. I am certainly interested in learning how I can do this so I can use it in future apps that I build. Within the app, I created a tableView cell with a single blank view and used the framework to populate that view. If I had more time to build and research frameworks, I certainly see the value in being able to export a UITableView cell as opposed to a UIView. I chose to use a framework to export a UIView instead of just omitting this requirement because I want to show that I don't walk away from hard challenges. I will always put my best foot forward and make an effort on everything that I am tasked to do.
- I used the Decodable protocol to make my network requests. I am familiar with JSONSerialization but prefer to use Codable.
- I'm sure that there are many good ways to write a custom function to convert Square Kilometers to Square Miles. I searched google to find the proper numbers to complete the conversion. I love using NumberFormatter because I know that users find large numbers hard by themselves.
- The icon I used for the app was from www.iconfinder.com and is free for commercial use. 
- I code using MVC. With this specific app, I didn't add a dedicated Model Controller as I was able to achieve all functionality to interact with my models in the network controller.
- I chose not to add lots of color or flashy animations to an app because I believe that animations should not draw attention to themselves and should only be used enhance user experience. Since this app simply loads a tableview one time when it opens, I didn't find animations necessary.
- I am looking forward to receiving feedback and what I could have done to make this a better application. While I always strive to produce polished products, I understand that I have much more to learn. All feedback positive/negative is welcome. Thank you!
